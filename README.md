# planck_PR4_lensing
Planck PR4 (NPIPE) lensing likelihoods, by J. Carron, M. Mirmelstein and A. Lewis.

This repository contains the Planck lensing likelihoods built from Planck PR4(NPIPE) data, in a Cobaya-friendly format.
These are slightly more powerful (up to 20%) than the corresponding ones of the PR3 (2018) Planck release.

See [the paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2206.07773) for details.

MCMC chains and 2018-like PR4 lensing maps are available [here](https://github.com/carronj/planck_PR4_lensing/releases/tag/Data)

See [this paper](https://arxiv.org/abs/2007.04997) for the Planck NPIPE maps and [this one](https://arxiv.org/abs/2005.05290) for Cobaya.
